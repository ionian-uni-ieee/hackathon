# Hackathon

## Introduction

The folders above contain the very basic architecture for a python web app. 

The folder named `flask_project` contains the base for a Flask project, and the folder named `django_project` contains the base for a Django app. 

In both cases, an SQLite database is installed for your convenience. 

*Feel free to delete the folder you will not use on your project.*

## Python virtual environment

In order to minimize the space the application will use on your device, each project has a python virtual  environment. For more information, visit --> https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

In order to activate it, go to the path that contains the folder named `venv` run the following command:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Install requirements

In order to install all the necessary requirements, in each project, a file named `requirements.txt` was created. In order to install the requirements, run the command:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
